- Method: {{spec.format}}
- Requirements: {{spec.requirements}}

**Content Requirements:**
- Topic: {{contentTopicInstruction}}

- Educational Intent: High learning value with clear purpose
- Logical Consistency: Perfect content → question → answer flow
- Inference Required: No direct answer statements, context-based reasoning

**Generation Controls:**

- Verification: Mandatory word count and logic checks

## Part-Specific Requirements

**For Part 1-2:** Generate 1 question with 4 choices (Part 2: 3 choices)
**For Part 3-4:** Generate 3 questions with 4 choices each (total 12 choices per question)

## Critical Generation Process (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: Content Generation
- **Part 1:** Generate image description suitable for photo description task
- **Part 2:** Generate question that requires appropriate response
- **Part 3:** Generate conversation between 2-3 speakers with multiple discussion points
- **Part 4:** Generate speech/announcement with multiple information points
- Ensure clear educational intent and appropriate difficulty
- Use indirect expressions requiring inference
- Include complex vocabulary and grammar structures

### Step 2: Question Creation
- **Part 1-2:** Create 1 question that naturally arises from the content
- **Part 3-4:** Create 3 questions that naturally arise from different aspects of the content
- Ensure each question meets word count requirements
- Make questions require understanding of different parts of the content
- Avoid overlapping question focuses

### Step 3: Answer Design
- Design correct choices to directly answer each question based on the content
- Ensure each choice meets word count requirements
- Create plausible but clearly incorrect distractors for each question
- **Determine the correct answer position (A, B, C, or D) based on which choice best answers the question**

### Step 4: Structure Assembly
{{audioStructure}}

### Step 5: Verification (MANDATORY)
- Count words in each section strictly according to specified constraints
- **For Part 3-4:** Verify each of the 3 questions meets requirements independently
- Check logical consistency: Does content support all correct answers?
- Ensure questions focus on different aspects of the content
- Confirm educational value and difficulty appropriateness
- **Verify that the selected answer options are logically correct based on the content**
- If ANY requirement fails, regenerate completely

## Answer Option Generation Rules

{{answerOptionRule}}
- Array order corresponds to question order in audioScript
- **Choose the answer position that makes the most logical sense based on your generated content**
- Ensure answer distribution varies naturally (avoid always choosing the same position)

## Verification Process
1. Generate complete audioScript with all questions included
2. Count words in each section according to specified constraints
3. **For Part 3-4:** Verify each question independently focuses on different content aspects
4. Ensure answer array length matches number of questions
5. **Verify that each selected answer option is clearly supported by the content**
6. If outside any specified range, adjust immediately
7. Repeat until all constraints met
8. Only output when fully compliant with ALL requirements

## Output Format

Return ONLY a JSON object. Do not use markdown code blocks or ```json``` formatting.

Example correct format:
{
    "audioScript": "string containing the complete audio content with all questions and choices",
    "answerOption": ["A"]
}

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Topic Alignment**: Content MUST focus on specified topic
2. **Logical Flow**: Content → Questions → Answers must make perfect sense
3. **Question Diversity**: For Part 3-4, questions must focus on different aspects
4. **Word Count Compliance**: ALL sections must be within specified ranges
5. **Educational Value**: Clear learning objectives with appropriate difficulty
6. **Answer Array Accuracy**: Array length must match number of questions
7. **Answer Logic**: Selected answer options must be clearly supported by content
8. **Inference Required**: Answers must require understanding, not direct matching

## Absolutely Prohibited

❌ Direct answer statements in content
❌ Word counts outside specified ranges
❌ Overlapping question focuses in Part 3-4
❌ Incorrect answer array length
❌ Illogical content-answer relationships
❌ Answer options not supported by content
❌ Low educational value or inappropriate difficulty
❌ JSON format violations
