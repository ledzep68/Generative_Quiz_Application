[Speaker1] Good morning, everyone. As the system administrator, I want to walk you through the new data management system we've implemented in our office. This system is designed to streamline our data processing and improve overall efficiency. First, you'll need to log in using your employee credentials. Once logged in, you can access the dashboard, which provides an overview of all current projects and their statuses. To update a project, simply click on the project name and enter the new data. The system automatically saves changes and updates the project timeline. Additionally, the system includes a backup feature that runs every night to ensure data security. If you encounter any issues, please contact the IT department for assistance. [pause] [Speaker2] What is the main purpose of the new system?
